We are a team of 4 undergraduates from the National University of Singapore participating in the High-Performance Computing Innovation Challenge for the Environment 2022 (HPCIC) organised by the National Supercomputing Center and have made finalists in the competition.

We have devised a autonomous controlled incubation environment for users to grow their plants. Sensors attached to our incubation environment collects data such as light intensity, water moisture, temperature and humidity. Users will have access to the data and are only required minor maintance with the available information.

A intital draft sketch

Our prototype consists of several components:
A soil pot
A water tank
A water pump
3mm silicone water tubes
Arduino Uno
LED strip
Soil moisture sensor
Temperature and humidity sensor
Fan
Mosquito net

Prototype will be powered from a wall plug via a USB-USB cable.
